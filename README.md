## Hi there, this is my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Becky.

##### Only Rebecca if offical or in trouble (so either way I panic ðŸ˜±)

Before School of Code I was looking after my family and before that I did childcare at college (so the mental age didn't change ðŸ˜„).
<br></br>
Now getting into code and tech as I want a career more than a job with the end goal being not dreading the alarm clock going of in the morning (other than it being in the morning ðŸ¥±).
