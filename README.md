# Hi there, this is my GitHub page 👋

#### My name is Becky.

##### Only Rebecca if official or in trouble (so either way I panic 😱)

Before School of Code I was looking after my family and before that I did childcare at college (so the mental age didn't change 😄).
<br></br>
Now getting into code and tech as I want a career more than a job with the end goal being not dreading the alarm clock going of in the morning (other than it being in the morning 🥱).
<br></br>
My github picture is my teddy Quackers, heres what I actually look like (Go Wasps! 🐝)
